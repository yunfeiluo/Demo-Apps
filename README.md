# Demo-Apps
This repository collects the small programs I've made. The application fields varies (e.g. localization, computer vision, and basic computation, etc.). The descriptions of each of these demo applications are presented in the following. They are open source and free to try them out. Any comments or ideas are wellcome! Have fun! 

## Hand Gesture Recognition
